Anime faces with GAN

Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. So the goal of this work was make a Generative NN to draw an Anime faces.
A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks 

Given a training dataset, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.
